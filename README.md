# RAG_GEN 
This project demonstrates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhancing generative AI performance.  
It combines the power of LLMs (Large Language Models) with custom document retrieval, allowing the model to generate more relevant and factual responses.

## 🚀 Features
 Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.
 Integrates context-based question answering using vector embeddings.
 Uses Python, LangChain, and FAISS/Chroma for document search.
 Interactive and well-documented **Jupyter Notebook** (`RAG_GEN.ipynb`).

## 🧩 Tech Stack
 Python 3.10+
 LangChain**
 FAISS / ChromaDB
 OpenAI / Hugging Face API
 Jupyter Notebook

##  How It Works
1. Load a dataset or knowledge base.
2. Split and embed text documents.
3. Store embeddings in a vector database.
4. When a question is asked, retrieve the most relevant context.
5. Pass the context to the LLM to generate a factual, context-aware answer.

## 📊 Example Use Case
Chatbots with access to private documents  
AI assistants for research papers or customer support  
Knowledge retrieval systems for organizations

## 📈 Results
- Improved factual accuracy compared to standalone LLM responses.
- Reduced hallucination rate due to context retrieval.
- Demonstrates strong foundation for building intelligent chatbots.

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Add UI (Streamlit-based web app)
- Implement fine-tuned models for domain-specific data
- Add evaluation metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, Precision@k)
